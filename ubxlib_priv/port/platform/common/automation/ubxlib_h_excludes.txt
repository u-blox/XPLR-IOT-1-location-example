# Place in this file the names of any .h files that appear in an API directory but are NOT
# meant to be included in ubxlib.h.  This list is read by the script u_run_check_ubxlib_h.py
# which does a relatively trivial check that nothing obvious has been left out ubxlib.h but
# there are some header files in public API directories which we deliberately do NOT want
# included.  Only file names should be listed.

# Example only
u_lib.h
u_lib_internal.h
lib_fibonacci.h
