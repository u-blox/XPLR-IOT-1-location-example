`ubxlib_builder` Docker Container
================
The `ubxlib_builder` container is used by all the Linux machines used in the test automation for ubxlib.
The image is based on Ubuntu 20.04 and contains all the dependencies that are required for ubxlib automation except the things that are handled by [u_packages](../../u_packages.yml).


# Building `ubxlib_builder` Locally
If you have installed `Docker` and `docker-compose` (for Ubuntu you can use [host_setup.sh](../host/host_setup.sh)) you can build `ubxlib_builder` by running the following command in this folder:

```sh
$ docker-compose build
```

# Running `ubxlib_builder` Locally
To run a command inside `ubxlib_builder` you use `docker-compose run`. Here is a hello world example:

```sh
$ docker-compose run --rm ubxlib_builder echo hello world
Creating builder_ubxlib_builder_run ... done
hello world
```

You can also use the container interactivly by opening a shell inside the container:

```sh
$ docker-compose run --rm ubxlib_builder sh
Creating builder_ubxlib_builder_run ... done
$ echo hello world
hello world
```

To use it with ubxlib you also need to mount the ubxlib- and home directory:

```sh
$ docker-compose run --rm -v $HOME/git/ubxlib_priv:/workdir/ubxlib -v $HOME:/home/ubxlib ubxlib_builder sh
Creating builder_ubxlib_builder_run ... done
$ inv -r ubxlib/port/platform/common/automation --list
Available tasks:

  arduino.build                    Build an Arduino based application
  arduino.check-installation       Check Arduino installation
  arduino.clean                    Remove all files for a nRF5 SDK build
  arduino.flash                    Flash an Arduino based application
  arduino.log                      Open a log terminal
  automation.build                 Build the firmware for an automation instance
  automation.export                Output the u_package environment
  automation.flash                 Flash the firmware for an automation instance
  automation.get-test-selection
...
```

# Updating the Linux Jenkins Slaves
For various reasons we are currently not using a Docker repo for handling our `ubxlib_builder`.
Instead a Jenkins job have been setup that will build the `ubxlib_builder` image for all the ubxlib Linux-based Jenkins slaves which can be found in the Jenkin classic mode under `Dashboard -> ubxlib -> ubxlib_docker_build`. To build the image press `Build with Parameters`, enter the branch where the new `Dockerfile` is located in the field `UBXLIB_PRIV_REV`, then press `Build`. When the images has been successfully built it will get used next time a ubxlib Jenkins job has been started.

NOTE: Before updating the slaves it is a good idea to first try building it locally as described above.
