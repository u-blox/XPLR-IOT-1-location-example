This is the API for GNSS.

It also contains a python script, [u_gnss_cfg_val_key.py](u_gnss_cfg_val_key.py): this script should be executed if the enums in [u_gnss_cfg_val_key.h](u_gnss_cfg_val_key.h) have been updated; it will re-write the header file to include a set of key ID macros that can be used by the application.
