/** A callback which will be called by uGnssMsgReceiveStart()

 * are uGnssMsgReceiveCallbackRead() / uGnssMsgReceiveCallbackExtract(),
 * no others or you risk getting* mutex-locked.

 * wild-cards) and a NACK is received for that message then
 * errorCodeOrLength will be set to #U_GNSS_ERROR_NACK and there
 * will be no message to read, otherwise errorCodeOrLength will
 * indicate the length of the message.
 * A simple construction might be to have set the pCallbackParam
 * when you called uGnssMsgReceiveStart() to the address of your
