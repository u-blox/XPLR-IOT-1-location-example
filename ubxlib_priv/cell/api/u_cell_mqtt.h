 * followed by uCellMqttInit() to put them back again.
 *
 * @param cellHandle             the handle of the cellular instance
 *                               to be used.
 * @param[in] pBrokerNameStr     the null-terminated string that gives
 *                               the name of the broker for this MQTT
 *                               session.  This may be a domain name,
 *                               or an IP address and may include a port
 *                               number.  NOTE: if a domain name is used
 *                               the module may immediately try to perform
 *                               a DNS look-up to establish the IP address
 *                               of the broker and hence you should ensure
 *                               that the module is connected beforehand.
 * @param[in] pClientIdStr       the null-terminated string that
 *                               will be the client ID for this
 *                               MQTT session.  May be NULL, in

 *                               a name.
 * @param[in] pUserNameStr       the null-terminated string that is the
 *                               user name required by the MQTT broker;
 *                               ignored for MQTT-SN.
 * @param[in] pPasswordStr       the null-terminated string that is the
 *                               password required by the MQTT broker;
 *                               ignored for MQTT-SN.
 * @param[in] pKeepGoingCallback certain of the MQTT API functions
 *                               need to wait for the broker to respond
 *                               and this may take some time.  Specify
 *                               a callback function here which will be
 *                               called while the API is waiting.  While
 *                               the callback function returns true the
 *                               API will continue to wait until success
 *                               or #U_MQTT_CLIENT_RESPONSE_WAIT_SECONDS
 *                               is reached.  If the callback function
 *                               returns false then the API will return.
 *                               Note that the thing the API was waiting for
 *                               may still succeed, this does not cancel
 *                               the operation, it simply stops waiting
