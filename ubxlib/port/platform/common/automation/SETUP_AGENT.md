# Introduction
This describes how to go about setting up a \[currently Windows only\] test agent.

Before setting up an agent, you need to decide which instances from [DATABASE.md](DATABASE.md) you intend the agent to support.

# Install Third Party Applications
Install on the agent the third party applications for the instances it will support; the version number of the application that the `ubxlib` code was tested with can usually be found in the `README.md` files for each platform.  Links are provided and, for internal u-blox use, the correct version of each application can be found pre-downloaded in the private repo https://github.com/u-blox/ubxlib_third_party.  Install to the suggested locations if you can; this way you will not have to make any changes to the default settings files generated by `u_settings.py`.

Note: when unzipping a downloaded file make sure to right-click and unblock it **before** unzipping or nothing you extract will be allowed to run.

| Required for             | Application                                   | Link                                              | Installation directory          |

|                          | `Git`: version control, unless you are well versed in `Vim`, suggest installing `notepad++` (see below) first and selecting it as the text editor for Git during installation. | https://git-scm.com/downloads | Anywhere on the path, let the installer choose. |

|                          | `make`: you are *strongly advised* to use the version at the link; there are other versions of `make` for Windows around that do not work correctly. | https://repo.msys2.org/mingw/x86_64/mingw-w64-x86_64-make-4.3-1-any.pkg.tar.xz | Rename `mingw32-make.exe` to `make.exe` and place it anywhere on the path provided it is *before* what follows. |

# Download Code And Configure The Agent

Create, a directory, e.g. `C:\agent`, in which to store the agent code.

Git clone into it https://github.com/u-blox/ubxlib, or for internal u-blox users Git clone https://github.com/u-blox/ubxlib_priv but into a `ubxlib` sub-directory instead of a `ubxlib_priv` sub-directory.  You should now have `C:\agent\ubxlib`.

Git clone https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity into it; you should now have `C:\agent\Unity` also.

Open a command window, with Administrator privileges, `CD` to `C:\agent\ubxlib\port\platform\common\automation` and run `python u_settings.py`.  This will spew out a load of warnings about things not existing and will create two settings files, `settings_v2.json` and `settings_v2_agent_specific.json`, in the directory`C:\Users\<your_username>\.ubx_automation`.  Open `settings_v2_agent_specific.json` in a text editor; if you installed any of the applications above (ignoring ones that are "anywhere on the path") into a directory other than the default, find the original entry in the file and edit it to match the location you used.  Then remove all of the `_FIX_ME` post-fixes in the file using search and replace and save the file.

# Attach Boards

If you have chosen instances for which hardware is required you should now attach each piece of hardware to the agent, one by one, setting up the appropriate values for COM port and (where relevant) debugger in `settings_v2_agent_specific.json`, adding each instance to the list of instances supported by the agent and checking that each instance is working as expected.

A few notes:

- make sure that each HW setup works before it is connected to the agent (e.g. by running `u_run.py` locally); specifically, newly purchased boards with on-board debug chips will often need to be updated with the latest debugger firmware before they can be used and this can often result in immediate failure when they are run automagically,
- make sure that the UART flow control lines between the MCU and each module are either (a) connected or (b) not connected and the relevant HW lines tied to ground, as required by the definition of the instance,
- if u-blox security is to be tested on an instance, make sure that (a) the module is security sealed (just set `U_CFG_SECURITY_DEVICE_PROFILE_UID` to the device profile UID for that module (without quotes) taken from the [Thingstream portal](https://portal.thingstream.io) and then run the `securitySeal` test) and (b) the module is given the special feature `LocalC2CKeyPairing` by a member of the u-blox security team,
- make backups of the settings files for each agent as you add each instance, just in case the files get re-written to defaults by the automation code, which may happen if an error is detected.
