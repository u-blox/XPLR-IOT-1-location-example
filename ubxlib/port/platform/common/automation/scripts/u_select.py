# been modified in a pull request and, given a database of
# ubxlib HW instances and knowledge of the ubxlib directory
# structure, decides which ubxlib instances should be run
# to verify that the modifications are good.
#
# The algorithm is as follows:
#
#            Changed                                     Action
#
# (a)    .md/.jpg etc. file                              ignore.
# (b)   platform-specific file             run all instances supporting that platform.
# (c) API/implementation *.c *.h file    run all instances supporting that API (according
#                                           to DATABASE.md); if just one then return
#                                              a filter string for that one.
# (d)     any .py file                       run Pylint to check for errors.
# (e)         any                            run Doxygen to check for errors.
#
# In addition to all of the above a quite separate check
# is provided: do any of the file paths that have been
# changed affect the ubxlib test automation.  This allows
# the caller to determine if those files need to be updated.
