# Introduction
These directories provide the porting layer that allows the high level C APIs to be built and run on a supported MCU.

No attempt is made to create a full MCU porting API; only the APIs necessary to run the high level C APIs are implemented here.

# Usage
The [api](api) directory defines the port API, each API function documented in the header file.  The [clib](clib) directory contains implementations of C library APIs that may be missing on some platforms (e.g. `strtok_r`, the re-entrant version of the `strtok` library function).  In the [platform](platform) directory you will find the implementation of the porting API on various target SDKs and MCUs and the necessary instructions to create a working binary and tests on each of those target MCUs.  Please refer to the `README.md` files in your chosen target platform directory for more information.

The [test](test) directory contains tests for this API that can be run on any platform.

# DIY
If your platform is not currently supported you may be able to port it yourself, something like this:
- provide implementations of the functions in the port [api](api); use the existing platform implementations for guidance (e.g. [platform/nrf5sdk/src](platform/nrf5sdk/src)):
  - the [initialisation](api/u_port.h) and [OS](api/u_port_os.h) interfaces are probably the simplest: you will need task creation/deletion and an entry point into task-land, plain-old non-recursive mutexes, a way to queue things, a way to block a task for x milliseconds, a way to obtain a count of \[64-bit\] milliseconds since boot and also semaphores (the latter currently used only in the [common/short_range](/common/short_range) (i.e. Wi-Fi and BLE) APIs),
  - the common [platform/common/event_queue](platform/common/event_queue) code will likely form most of your implementation of the [u_port_event_queue.h](api/u_port_event_queue.h) API,
  - you will need a way to get [debug](api/u_port_debug.h) strings off the platform, i.e. \[non-floating point\] `printf()` to somewhere,
  - the [GPIO API](api/u_port_gpio.h) will require some plumbing into the specifics of your MCU,
  - the [UART API](api/u_port_uart.h) will likely be the most complex thing to implement; you will probably need to know details of the interrupt and DMA behaviours of your MCU to complete this,
  - if you intend to use a GNSS chip connected directly to your MCU via I2C then you will need to port the [I2C API](api/u_port_i2c.h),
  - some [crypto](api/u_port_crypto.h) functions are required if you want to use the security features in `ubxlib`; in our experience these are almost always provided by [mbedTLS](https://www.trustedfirmware.org/projects/mbed-tls/), in which case no modification to the existing port will be required (excepting differences arising from future [mbedTLS](https://www.trustedfirmware.org/projects/mbed-tls/) versions, e.g. we have not yet integrated with version 3),
  - for BLE you will require an implementation of the [GATT](api/u_port_gatt.h) access functions,
  - if your platform does not use [newlib](https://sourceware.org/newlib/) (if you are using GCC it will bring [newlib](https://sourceware.org/newlib/) with it) then you may find you are missing some C library functions; implementations of C library functions we have already found to be missing on some platforms can be found in [port/clib](/port/clib) and can just be hooked-in from there but you may need to add more if your code doesn't compile,
- provide your own versions of the header files `u_cfg_app_platform_specific.h`, `u_cfg_hw_platform_specific.h`, `u_cfg_test_platform_specific.h` and `u_cfg_os_platform_specific.h` (see examples in the existing platform directories); take particular note of translating the task priority values into those of your OS,
- provide your own build metadata files (for CMake, Make, a home-grown Python lash-up, whatever): usually your chosen platform will dictate the shape of these and you just need to add to your existing structure the paths to the `ubxlib` source files and the `ubxlib` include files; otherwise take a look at the existing [nrf5 GCC platform](platform/nrf5sdk/mcu/nrf52/gcc/runner) or [static_size](platform/static_size) platforms as a starting point (though note that the latter does not bring in any `platform` or `test` files),
- add [Unity](https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity) to your build and then compile and run the tests in [u_port_test.c](test/u_port_test.c): if these pass then you have likely completed the necessary porting.

# Shared CMake file
For ports that use CMake [ubxlib.cmake](ubxlib.cmake) can be used to collect the `ubxlib` source code files, include directories etc.
`ubxlib.cmake` is typically included in a port specific CMake file and will then define a couple of variables that the calling CMake file can make use of (see the [esp32 component CMakeLists.txt](platform/esp-idf/mcu/esp32/components/ubxlib/CMakeLists.txt) as example).

Before including `ubxlib.cmake` you must set the variable `UBXLIB_BASE` to root directory of `ubxlib`.

You must also specify what `ubxlib` features to enable using the `UBXLIB_FEATURES` variable described below.

## UBXLIB_FEATURES
Available features currently are:
* `u_lib`: Include the `lib_common` API
* `short_range`: Include `wifi`, `ble` and `short_range` API
* `cell`: Include `cell` API
* `gnss`: Include `gnss` API

**IMPORTANT:** This is under development so `short_range`, `cell` and `gnss` must currently always be enabled.

## Example
```cmake
set(UBXLIB_BASE <path_to_ubxlib>)
# Set the ubxlib features to compile (all needs to be enabled at the moment)
set(UBXLIB_FEATURES short_range cell gnss)

# From this line we will get back:
# - UBXLIB_SRC
# - UBXLIB_INC
# - UBXLIB_PRIVATE_INC
# - UBXLIB_TEST_SRC
# - UBXLIB_TEST_INC
include(${UBXLIB_BASE}/port/ubxlib.cmake)
```

## Output Variables
After `ubxlib.cmake` has been included the following variables will be available:
* `UBXLIB_SRC`: A list of all the .c files
* `UBXLIB_INC`: A list of the public include directories
* `UBXLIB_PRIVATE_INC`: A list of the private include directories required to build ubxlib
* `UBXLIB_TEST_SRC`: A list of all the test .c files
* `UBXLIB_TEST_INC`: A list of test include directories

# Shared Makefile
For ports that use `make` [ubxlib.mk](ubxlib.mk) can be used to collect the `ubxlib` source code files, include directories etc in the same way as for CMake above.

Just like the shared CMake file you must first set the variable `UBXLIB_BASE` to root directory of `ubxlib` and configure the `ubxlib` features using the `UBXLIB_FEATURES` (please see [UBXLIB_FEATURES](#UBXLIB_FEATURES) above). `ubxlib.mk` will then define the same output variables as the shared CMake above (see [Output Variables](#Output-Variables))

## Example
```makefile
# Include ubxlib src and inc
UBXLIB_BASE = <path_to_ubxlib>
UBXLIB_FEATURES = cell gnss short_range
# From this line we will get back:
# - UBXLIB_SRC
# - UBXLIB_INC
# - UBXLIB_PRIVATE_INC
# - UBXLIB_TEST_SRC
# - UBXLIB_TEST_INC
include $(UBXLIB_BASE)/port/ubxlib.mk
```
