# libfibonacci application example

This is an application showing some simple use of the `ubxlib` library example, `libfibonacci`.

To build and flash from the current folder for an Nordic nRF5340 board:
```
$ west build -p auto -b nrf5340dk_nrf5340_cpuapp
$ west flash
```

This application includes the library as a data array as generated by the library make script.

During building, the libfibonacci make script will produce a `libfibonacci/` folder under zephyrs `build/` folder. In here, there is an artefact named `libfibonacci_blob.c`. This file contains an array being the actual library blob. The file is added to the application in the utility cmake script `common/lib_common/example/platform/zephyr/libfibonacci.cmake`
