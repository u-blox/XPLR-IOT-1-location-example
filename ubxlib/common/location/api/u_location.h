 * may need to call uCellLocSetPinGnssPwr() and
 * uCellLocSetPinGnssDataReady() in the cellular API to tell the
 * cellular module which pins of the cellular module the GNSS chip is
 * attached on.  If you prefer to use the GNSS chip directly rather

 *                                establishment process, useful where several

 *                                be assumed (and Cloud Locate will not work).
 * @param pAuthenticationTokenStr the null-terminated authentication token,
 *                                required by some cloud services (for example
 *                                Cell Locate).
 * @param pLocation               a place to put the location; may be NULL. In
 *                                particular, when using the Cloud Locate service,

 *                                required by this device (if it is sufficient
 *                                for it to be known in the cloud).
 * @param pKeepGoingCallback      a callback function that governs how long
 *                                location establishment is allowed to take.
 *                                This function is called while waiting for
 *                                location establishment to complete; location
 *                                establishment will only continue while
 *                                it returns true.  This allows the caller
 *                                to terminate the locating process at
 *                                their convenience.  This function may
 *                                also be used to feed any watchdog
 *                                timer that might be running.  May be NULL,
 *                                in which case location establishment will
 *                                stop when #U_LOCATION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS have
 *                                elapsed.  The single int32_t parameter is
 *                                the network handle, but note that if
 *                                pLocationAssist->networkHandleAssist is
 *                                set then the network handle may be that
 *                                of the assisting network, depending on
 *                                what stage location establishment is at.
 * @return                        zero on success or negative error code
 *                                on failure.
